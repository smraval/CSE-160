Welcome to my assignment 1! 

For the start of this assignment I followed all the conventions from the professor's videos. Moving forward into the later steps, I modified my code based on the textbook references mentioned in the assignment. For variable names and functions, I tried to stick to the same textbook convention style along with whatever was outlined in the rubric. I also left/ copied comments from the textbook within the code or added in comments like that.  

To improve my program and make it better, I did the following: 
- Attempted to fill the gaps for brush strokes 
- Triangle positioning and alignment on drag 
- Eraser functionality
- Additionally, I added a small (very simple) target practice game that spawns targets that the user can click to get a score
-
